<h3 align="center">Overview</h3>

**Memory** is the final project in the course **Programmeringsteknik (DD1310)** at KTH.  
The project is implemented in **Python** and models a memory game. Running the code will open a Tkinter GUI window where you specify the size of the board. After finishing the game, a window asking for your name will pop-up. Write your name and the textfile highscore will update and show you your name and score, together with recent scores.

The file **Memo** consists of the words that may appear in the game.

The file **Highscore** saves the name and score of every participant.

The file **Memory** is the main file.
